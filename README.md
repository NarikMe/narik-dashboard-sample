# narik-dashboard-sample

Sample dashboard created with Narik.

In this project , I create a dashboard system (designer and viewer) with multiple dynamic widgets.  

## Widgets

- [x] Link
- [x] Todo List
- [] Chart
- [] Map
- [] Data
- [] Gauge
- [] DateTime
- ....

Do you have any suggestion? Create an issue for that.
