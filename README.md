# narik-dashboard-sample

Sample dashboard created with Narik.  

[Online Demo](http://narik.me/demo/dashboard)   

In this project , I create a dashboard system (designer and viewer) with multiple dynamic widgets.  

## Widgets

- [x] Link
- [x] Todo List
- [x] Chart
- [ ] Map
- [ ] Data
- [x] Gauge
- [x] DateTime
- [ ] ....

Do you have any suggestion? Create an issue for that.
